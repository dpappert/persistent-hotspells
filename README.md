# Persistent hot spells

This repository contains code relating to the study in the (preprint) journal article in Weather and Climate Dynamics (WCD, Copernicus Publications), titled [name of paper]. Additional information can be found in the [ supplementary materials - hyperlink]

It contains the Python code to perform the following:

* regional clustering based on temperature anomalies
* compute hot spells for different regions
* compute long/short spell composites and calculate statistical significance of the anomaly fields
